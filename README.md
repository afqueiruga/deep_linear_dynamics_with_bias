# Training dynamics of deep linear models with biases

It is well known that deep linear, $\hat{y} = (WU)x$ models have a low-rank inductive bias.
But what about deep linear models with biases, $\hat{y} = W(Ux+u) + w$?

This repo performs experiments to understand those training dynamics.

This is also an experiment in pure AI-driven research.
I am reading the code it writes and running it myself, but all of the code and content will be entirely written by Codex.
I will try to get Codex to do longer and longer runs.
